# Cake.Issues Recipe

This is a recipe for using [Cake.Issues] in your Cake build script.

Compared to using the [Cake.Issues] addins directly in your build script, this recipe provides a pre-made integration with
support for different linters and integration into different build systems.

For more information how to use it and documentation about the addins see the [Cake.Issues website](https://cakeissues.net)
and for general information about the Cake build automation system see the [Cake website](http://cakebuild.net)
